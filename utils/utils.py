    Upload some text or code to the [paste.rs](https://paste.rs/)
    
    Args:
        text (str): a text or a code to upload.
        ext (str): a file extension. If pass `md`, `mdown`, or `markdown`, the paste is rendered as
          markdown into HTML. If ext is a known code file extension, the paste
          is syntax highlighted and returned as HTML. If ext is a known format
          extension, the paste is returned with the format's corresponding
          Content-Type. Otherwise, the paste is returned as unmodified text.
        allow_206 (bool): Should the response code 206 be allowed?
          If the response code is 201 (CREATED), then the entire paste was
          uploaded. If the response is 206 (PARTIAL), then the paste exceeded
          the server's maximum upload size, and only part of the paste was
          uploaded. If the response code is anything else, an error has
          occurred. Pasting is heavily rate limited.
    
    Returns:
        str: a link to the paste.
    
    Exceptions:
        requests.exceptions.HTTPError:
